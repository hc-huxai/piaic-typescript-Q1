  <!-- - **Spacer**
    Spacer function takes one optional parameter that specifies how many empty lines should be displayed in the output. If the parameter has no value, it will be set to 1.
    Syntax: Spacer(no_of_lines)
    <hr>
  - **SpaceAround**
    SpaceAround functions similarly to the Spacer function. The only difference is that it takes a function as a parameter and prints a given number of empty lines around it. If the number of lines before and after functions is not given, it is set to 1.
    Syntax: SpaceAround(function, space_before, space_after)
    <hr>
  - **getInput**
    getInput function uses a npm package 'prompt-sync' to get user input in console. IT also accepts an optional parameter as string to show prompt in console.
    Syntax: getInput(message_to_show)
    <hr>
  - **Custom-Prototypes**
    It has specialized functions for working with various data kinds. For instance, consider a method that converts all strings in an array to LowerCase format. This function does not exist in TS/JS natively. -->

- **Program Execution Instruction**
  Almost every program rely on node_modules and custom-built functions (EOA-Functions). There are two ways to run programs from this repository.

  - Clone the whole repository. Run `npm install` in the root directory. Then execute the program.
  - Download the build file of a particular file from build folder.
    Files in build folder are compiled with all modules included. Download the file and run `node <filename>.js` to execute the program.
