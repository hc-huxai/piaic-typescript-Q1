- ### Typescript

  - TypeScript is a strongly typed, object-oriented programming language built on JavaScript. It is a superset of JavaScript.
  - It was designed by Anders Hejlsberg, designer of C# at Microsoft.
  - TypeScript is a open source language, backed by Microsoft.
  - TypeScript is "JavaScript with type annotation".

- ### NextJS

  - NextJS is a React framework that allows you to build SEO-friendly, supercharged websites and web apps.
  - It is built on React Framework.
  - NextJS was built due to React being a single page application and not too SEO-optimized.
  - NextJS provides hybrid static and server rendering, TypeScript support, route prefetching, and more.

- ### Vercel

  - Vercel is a cloud platform that enables developers to host websites and web services that deploy instantly, scale automatically, and require no supervision.
  - It was founded in 2015.
  - Vercel was formerly known as ZEIT.
  - Vercel allows developers to set up their projects to a custom domain or a free URL (provided by Vercel) .
  - It's integration with GitHub and GitLab allows developers to host static websites and web applications quickly.

- ### Headless CMS

  - CMS stands for Content Management System.
  - Headless CMS is a content management system that manages and organizes content without a connected front-end or display layer.
  - The headless CMS is where all of your content and assets live.
  - Then, you use a content API to distribute that content to anywhere and everywhere you need it --- your website, your mobile app, your email marketing, your CRM, etc.

- ### SQL Databases

  - SQL database or relational database is a collection of highly structured tables, wherein each row reflects a data entity, and every column defines a specific information field.
  - Relational databases are built using the structured query language (SQL) to create, store, update, and retrieve data.
  - Therefore, SQL is the underlying programming language for all relational database management systems (RDBMS) such as MySQL, Oracle, and Sybase, among others.

- ## NFT
- NFT stands for Non-Fungible Token. "Non-fungible" means that it's unique and can't be replaced by something else.
  > For example, a bitcoin is fungible -- trade one for another and you'll still have the same thing.
- However, NFTs are like Pokemon Cards. You trade Squirtle for Bulbasaur.
- So What exactly is NFT?
  > An NFT is a digital asset that can come in the form of art, music, in-game items, videos, and more. They are bought and sold online, frequently with cryptocurrency, and they are generally encoded with the same underlying software as many cryptos.
